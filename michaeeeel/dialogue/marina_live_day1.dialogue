Marina: Hey, Ami! I was just thinking about us today and decided to boot up OceanOS… and turns out you're online too!
Marina: What a coincidence! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

buffer
- I'm really glad to hear from you again.
	Marina: That makes me really happy to hear, Ami.
- Didn't expect you to still have this installed.
	Marina: Honestly? Me neither lol
- You are really here? Still using this? Seriously?
	Marina: I know, right? This thing should be ancient by now

Marina: Honestly? I didn't think it would even run,
Marina: but something made me want to click it today. Like a spark of nostalgia or something...

Marina: *0x4ACE0F790 --EO3_SIGSEV?

buffer
- What was that...?

Marina: Hmm? Bah... just a bug? Anyway...
Marina: I still remember when we stayed up ‘til 3 AM trying to make the window close without crashing
Marina: It’s a miracle our parents never noticed
Marina: And when we added Mizuko, even though neither of us knew how to code AI behavior properly lol

buffer
- ..she's running smoother than I expected. Better than we ever made her, actually.

Marina: Oh? Is she?
Marina: Guess she got clever without us. CUTE!

buffer
- You jealous the AI girl is smarter now? She really surprised me.
	Marina: Maybe just a little~ I helped make her too, y'know!
- Indeed she is very cute. I can’t believe she works this well.
	Marina: Right?? It's kind of unreal.
- Besides her being smarter, she hasn’t really changed. I missed her too.
	Marina: Yeah... I get that feeling.

buffer
- It feels like waking up an old ghost program. A very cute ghost.

Marina: She’s like a cute ghost program, huh… I like that.
Marina: maybe we all leave little ghosts behind in our code.
Marina: Just like GHOST IN THE SHELL.
Marina: Did you watch the live action? It sucked.

buffer
- I knew you would think that. I thought about you when I saw the promos.
- Didn’t see it tho, what part of it sucked?

Marina: Wait, wait! I found a cat photo on my old cache!

buffer
- A cat? My OS version also still had the random photo of one!

Marina: And I think you took that one, actually!
Marina: so it felt right to send it back to you~

buffer
- I think I remember naming the cat folder ‘Catstrophic assets’…
	Marina: YOU DID. And I laughed every time I saw it.
- If you say so… my memory’s blurry. Don’t remember taking it.
	Marina: Heh, that's okay. I remembered for the both of us.
- It makes me weirdly emotional seeing it again. I really took lots of cat pictures.
	Marina: You really did... it's kinda soft in a dumb way.

Marina: You did! Anyway… speaking of memory. How’ve you been?
Marina: did you ever go full into coding like you talked about?
Marina: I always thought you’d make something great with that mind of yours.

buffer
- Last time we talked, you wanted to study filmography. Did you? Do you have any cool student film done?

Marina: Ah, yeah! About that…

Marina: *0x000000?std::variant->value()==nullptr
Marina: Sorry! Something came up. I should go for now.
Marina: Ah, damned bugs again lol, this os is a mess

buffer
- No worries. It just feels nice to talk again.
	Marina: Yeah... it really does.
- Alright! Come back tomorrow. If OceanOS doesn’t explode first lol
	Marina: Haha, fingers crossed.
- Okay. Take care, Marina.
	Marina: You too, Ami.

Marina: Take care!
Marina: [#set_flag=talked_to_marina_day_one]And I’ll message you again tomorrow. promise
